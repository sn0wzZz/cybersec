          <p>
            Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying
            vulnerabilities commonly known in information systems only by using
            automated assessment methods. The term is often associated with
            penetration tests and the two are widely used interchangeably.
            However, there are important differences between the two terms, so
            don&apos;t confuse them. Penetration testing focuses on exploiting
            the discovered vulnerabilities and on the other hand vulnerability
            assessment only identifies the vulnerabilities in the system without
            actually testing/exploiting them. This service includes automatic
            vulnerability scanning priority based on impact, severity and
            probability. This is suitable for organizations that are keen to
            gain an overview and awareness of cyber security. The main objective
            is to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized
            access and exposure of data to unauthorized persons.

            <strong>• Scan scope</strong> <br /> We can help you determine which
            part of your IT infrastructure could benefit most from vulnerability
            scanning. It is always a good idea to eliminate IP addresses,
            domains or system that are inactive or have almost no ports,
            interfaces or services available. <br /> <br />
            <strong>• Signing a contract</strong> <br /> Your company will sign
            an agreement with us as well as an NDA. The scope of the project
            will be outlined in the contract to ensure that we do not breach the
            scope of the scan. The start and duration of the assignment are also
            defined and noted in the contract. <br /> <br />
            <strong>• Perform the scanning</strong> <br /> Our team will begin
            the vulnerability scan and notify you if there are any performance
            or connectivity issues during the scan. <br /> <br />
            <strong>• Delivery of the final report</strong> <br /> The final
            product is an automated scanner report reviewed and approved by our
            experts. It includes a summary and classification of
            vulnerabilities, images, as well as risk mitigation recommendations
            and references.
