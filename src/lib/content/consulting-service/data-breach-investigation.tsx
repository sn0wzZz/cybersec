          During a breach in your systems, it is important to act quickly to
          contain the threat and its risks, and to minimize the impact by
          getting to the root cause. However, ignoring obvious procedures can
          limit your ability to help legal or government authorities investigate
          and analyze the threat. Our digital forensics professionals will work
          closely with your companyâ€™s crisis communications team to provide the
          public and customers with up-to-date information on any personal
          information that may have been compromised, as well as information on
          the steps being taken to protecting customers against future
          incidents. <br /> <br /> As the main steps of cyber incident
          investigation activities, our specialists will help you uncover any
          information related to the causes, facts and consequences of a cyber
          incident. At the end of each investigation, a full report is provided
          to the service, which includes all facts and circumstances,
          photographic material, recommendations, conclusions and analyses.
