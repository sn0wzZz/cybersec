          <p>
            Building their own SOC (Security Operations Centre) requires
            organizations to make significant investments in security software,
            hardware and other infrastructure. It requires hiring experts,
            building 24/7 monitoring and response. The concept of outsourcing
            this type of activity provides external cybersecurity experts who
            monitor events, devices, cloud environments and the corporate
            network for already known and evolving advanced threats. Such
            services are becoming increasingly popular among businesses and
            organizations as part of regulatory compliance. By trusting a
            partner that provides these types of services, organizations reduce
            capital expenditures and receive a solution designed for their
            needs. SOC as a service saves businesses time and money by offering
            off-the-shelf centers and relying on the expertise of professionals.
            Implementing the service does not require the commitment of internal
            company resources and can easily scale to meet the needs of
            organizations.
