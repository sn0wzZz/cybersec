          The following Terms and Conditions apply when you view or use the
          website located at synack.com (the “Site”). Synack offers a platform
          and related services to businesses seeking to securely crowdsource
          vulnerability testing of their websites by allowing volunteer members
          of the public (who have registered and been approved as a
          “Researcher”) to identify and report software bugs. Researchers may be
          eligible for “bug bounties”, or awards if they meet the eligibility
          criteria. Synack’s services are offered to customers subject to a
          confidential stand-alone Customer Agreement and Researchers similarly
          must agree to a separate and confidential Researcher Agreement.
